## Description

It is a game where you can move the blob around, and I changed certain aspects such as the color, size, speed, background color, and font size to reflect sadness. 

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces
